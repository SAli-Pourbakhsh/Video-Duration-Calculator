\## 🚀 How to Run (3 Ways)



Choose the method that suits you best:



\### Method 1: No Installation Required (Easiest)

If you don't have Python installed or just want a quick start:

1\.  Go to the \[\*\*Releases\*\*](https://github.com/SAli-Pourbakhsh/Video-Duration-Calculator/releases) page.

2\.  Download the latest `VideoCalculator.exe`.

3\.  Double-click to run.



\### Method 2: The Automatic Launcher (Recommended for Windows)

If you have Python installed but don't want to manage dependencies manually:

1\.  Download the source code (Clone or Download ZIP).
